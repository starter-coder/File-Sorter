## Usage
Its pretty easy to use.
* Select the source and destination folder by using the select button or you can type the path in. Then select the sort button to sort your files.
* You can use the File Count button to see how many files are in the source folder at any time.
* There is a Delete Folder button which you can use to delete your source folder.
* If the app is showing the Sort button or Delete Folder button in light gray colour, then it means it is currently sorting or deleting folder. Once the process is complete, it will change it back to dark gray.
* Exceptions (Permission Error and FileNotFoundError) are displayed on run window(or cmd or console).
## Installation
* Download both files sorting_gui.py and move_files.py in the same folder.
* Run sorting_gui.py
## Widows vs MAC Issue
The gui comes up as usual on windows but when run on MAC, it doesnt come up as expected.
